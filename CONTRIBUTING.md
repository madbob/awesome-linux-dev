# Contribution Guidelines

## Adding to this list

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Only free and opensource software is accepted.
- The list is mainly intended for desktop applications, or at least online services with a local client: do not submit server-side tools.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make sure the list is useful before submitting. That implies it has enough content and every item has a good succinct description.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.

Thank you for your suggestions!

## Improving your own tools

Lots of smart utilities on Linux are available only as command-line applications: please consider the opportunity to create a graphical front-end for your preferred tool, using your preferred method, to make them more user-friendly, accessible and even smarter.

Once implemented and published a viable enough solution, submit a [Request For Package to Debian](https://wiki.debian.org/RFP) or to your preferred distribution.
